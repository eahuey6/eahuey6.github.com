                <p>The article “Best Practice for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows” by Naema Baskanderi discusses what a modal window is when to use it, and tips for designing them for good usability. Baskanderi notes that for successful usability, these modal windows should include an escape hatch, a descriptive title, a button, correct sizing and location, a focus effect, and it should be user-initiated. Baskanderi also suggests that modal windows should not be used on mobile devices. She also talks about the importance of considering accessibility and thinking of ways a user may not be able to interact with a modal window and accommodating to that. </p>

                <p>I thought this article was pretty interesting because modal windows are commonly used on many websites and mobile apps. They are especially common when a user first opens a website, a modal window often pops up encouraging the user to sign up for their website or newsletter. This is particularly common on news and retail websites. Overall, although Baskanderi discourages the use of modal windows for most situations, she lays out a lot of helpful tips for designing modal windows that help the user’s experience. I will take these tips into consideration and reference this article if I create a design that uses modal windows. </p>

                <p class="aDate">17 OCTOBER 2021</p>

            <section class="aText">
                <p>The article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari elaborates on 20 key tips for designing a user-friendly form. Ansari includes tips including minimizing the input fields, sizing fields accordingly, and asking the easy questions first. I thought that this article was really interesting and I learned a lot about common usability issues in forms. For instance, I was surprised to read that placeholder text and inline labels within the form field can confuse users. I’ve seen this done in many forms, and I initially thought that this was more helpful to the users rather than harmful. Ansari also talks about being careful with default values, which as a user I have experienced frustration with, so I understand how it can be frustrating to other users.</p>

                <p>Ansari also discusses some more minor tips, such as minimizing dropdown menus and considering checkboxes instead. Most forms still include dropdowns, so I thought this was interesting, but I also understand now that checkboxes instead can reduce interaction and it allows for all the options to be visible. Another small tip that has a large effect is not including reset or clear buttons within the forms at all. Like Ansari talks about, these clear buttons can be confused with submit buttons if the user isn’t entirely paying attention or doesn’t read carefully. This can cause major frustration in the users if they accidentally clear the form that they had been working on and have to re-fill out all the information.</p>

                <p>Ansari also writes about the importance of providing a designed form that is accessible to as many users as possible. I believe this is essential as well, not making a form accessible limits the types and numbers of people that can fill out the form. To consider this, Ansari discusses color communication for people who are colorblind, allowing the users to control text size, and enabling screen readers. Some other ways to make the form more accessible are providing different translations of the form in various languages. This opens up the form to other countries and people who do not speak the English language. Overall, Ansari’s article provided me with great insight into what to consider when designing a form to make a pleasant experience for the users.</p>

                <p>One form that exemplifies these tips is the <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp">Google account sign-up form</a>. This form demonstrates minimizing input fields, utilizing multiple steps, sizing fields accordingly, and many more of Ansari’s tips. Although the sign-up form does follow most of the steps mentioned in the article, it does also include some of the parts that Ansari writes to be careful about such as using inline labeling and not following a one-column layout.</p>
