    <h1>Usability Report</h1>
    
    <h2>Divya</h2>

    <div id="images">
        <img src="images/divya.png" alt="screenshot of zoom usability test with Divya">
    </div>
    
    <p>From my user test with Divya over zoom, I noticed that her first instinct was to create an affirmation for herself, since affirmations are often correlated to affirming oneself. She suggested that I add a category so people can write affirmations to themselves. She noted that on the thank you page, the button “go to gallery” is broken when hovered over. When she was navigating the site, I also noticed that she was able to move to the next page (the thank you page) even without filling the forms.</p>
    <p>From Divya’s usability test, I was able to make a lot of good observations and catch many things that I had not thought of prior. I plan on adding the extra category so that people can write affirmations to themselves and fixing the go gallery button. I also will work on the code so that the form cannot be submitted empty.</p>


    <h2>Glenda</h2>
    <p>From my user test with Glenda, I noticed that she didn’t have issues with the form while going through it. After the test, Glenda noted that on the home page, one of the buttons looks selected and one of them does not. She also noted that the layout change from the home page to the rest of the website may be confusing to users. She also pointed out that there was no indication of what page the user is on in the navigation bar, which can be confusing. She also mentioned that making the nav buttons closer in proximity would be better for user experience and read better as a navigation section. Glenda also suggested that to condense the gallery, I could allow the user to choose a keyword that the affirmation is about and display that on the cards instead of the full affirmation.</p>
    <p>I got a lot of good suggestions and feedback from Glenda’s usability test. Due to the remaining timeframe of the project, I will probably only be able to implement some of the suggestions. I do plan on implementing the changes on the nav bar that were suggested. </p>


    <h2>Jackie</h2>

    <div id="images">
        <img src="images/jackie.JPG" alt="picture of usability test with Jackie">
    </div>
    
    <p>While observing the user test with Jackie, I noticed that my example on the form page was a little confusing and not worded correctly. Afterwards, Jackie noted that the instructions were not as clear on the form page and that adding more context may be helpful for the user. I also noticed that he was a bit confused about the form and wasn’t sure whether to click “submit affirmation” in the nav bar or the “affirm” button on the bottom of the form. When discussing the questions afterwards, he noted that he was a bit confused at that part because after filling out the form, he didn’t know which button to press because “submit affirmation” sounds like a submit button for the form. Jackie noted that he liked how the user could tag who it was addressed to (stranger, friend, etc.). Like I observed from Divya in the first test, Jackie also noticed that the form could be submitted with all the fields being empty.</p>
    <p>Overall, I got good suggestions from the usability test with Jackie. I plan on working on rewording the navigation bar and form so that it's not as confusing when the user is submitting the form. I also plan on rewording the instructions on the form page to give more context and hopefully make the calls to action more clear. </p>
