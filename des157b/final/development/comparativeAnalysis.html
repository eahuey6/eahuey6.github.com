    <h1>Final Project Comparative Analysis</h1>
    
    <h2><a href="https://theunsentproject.com/">The Unsent Project</a></h2>

    <p><a href="https://theunsentproject.com/">The Unsent Project</a> is very similar to my project but with a different purpose and general topic. The design is very simple and based on a card and grid system. The website overall does not look very designed and sometimes the image quality of the cards are not very high quality. The design of the cards can also be improved, some aspects of it donâ€™t make a lot of sense, such as the ABC in the top left corner of each of the cards. The overall user experience of the website is simple and intuitive. The website uses colors and the creator, Rora Blue, intentions were to understand what colors people associate with certain emotions and experiences.</p>


    <h2><a href="https://space.galaxybuster.net/">Space Email</a></h2>
    <div id="images">
        <img src="images/spaceEmail.png" alt="space email website">
    </div>
    <p><a href="https://space.galaxybuster.net/">Space Email</a>  is also somewhat similar to my project in that it deals with anonymous messages. This website allows the user to receive and send anonymous emails to random people. The design of this website fits the space theme but the interface is also pretty limited. Some of the buttons and actions are not intuitive though. In order to receive an anonymous email, the user must click the refresh button, which is a bit unclear. Some of the other buttons are also unclear as to what they lead to and their purpose. Overall its a simple design and concept but the user experience could be improved.</p>
