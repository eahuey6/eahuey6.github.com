    <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>
    
    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>I plan on building a website where people can anonymously affirm others addressed to vague names. Here, viewers can also look at the affirmations and maybe find one addressed to them and/or feel encouraged. </p>


    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow an outlet for affirming people if you don’t know their name</li>
        <li>Allow outlet for affirming people even if you do know their name </li>
        <li>Create a safe space and encouraging for users who are reading other affirmations</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>I plan on making the page simple, clean, and using either mainly white with black and gray highlights and lines, or adding some other tan neutral colors as the accent colors. I also will be mixing a serif font, Marcellus, for the header text and a sans-serif font, Inter, for the body text. As for the individual affirmations, I plan on using a grid layout with the text closed in using black lines outlining each of the boxes. I also plan on trying to use negative space throughout the website. Overall, I am planning on trying to make the website simple as to highlight the content of the affirmations. </p>


    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>For user interaction, I plan on using buttons and forms so the user can enter their affirmations. I also hope to use some animations, maybe with AOS to work with the cards or tiles of the affirmations. I do not plan on using aural feedback, but will include a congratulations page when someone submits an affirmation. Most of the website design and interaction will be based on users input and responses from the affirmation form, so most of the design and interactions will center around that.</p>

    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users can post affirmations anonymously through a form that puts the affirmation up on a gallery on the website</li>
        <li>Users feel satisfied and happy that they posted an affirmation and were able to lift someone up </li>
        <li>Users can also send their affirmation to someone through email if they know the person personally</li>
        <li>Users can read others’ affirmations that are posted on the website and they may sympathize with some of them or find a post directed towards themselves</li>
    </ul>
