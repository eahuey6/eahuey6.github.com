    <p>I met with two people who reviewed my first storyboard, and they said the idea was a good base and starting point. One person I met with suggested that I make my project more specific and focus on one aspect of culture rather than the general whole. I discussed my project idea with a few different people in the class and many of them had similar ideas for their own projects. During these discussions, I was trying to figure out a way to make my idea stand out and be different from others. While trying to think of alterations for my idea, I ended up thinking of a whole new idea.</p>


    <p>The second storyboard is a quick storyboard of my new idea. The new concept is supposed to be an affirtmations collection, where people can anonymously affirm people, whether that be someone they know or a stranger. The affirmations will be addressed vaguely and be unnamed, such as "to the person who helped me with carrying groceries to my car" or "to my younger sister".  </p>
